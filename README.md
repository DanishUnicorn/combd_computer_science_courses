# combd_computer_science_courses

This repository documents my self-directed journey into computer science, pursued alongside my MSc in Dairy Science and Technology. It includes notes, exercises, and projects from online coursesâ€”starting with Harvard's CS50 and CS50P via edX - as well as future topics I'll explore for personal growth. No academic credentials involved, just learning for the sake of learning.
